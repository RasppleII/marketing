License terms for this image will follow.  The nutshell version is that the
image will be available for modification under a free software license while
trying to express that this exact image should be for use with/about the
project for which it is created.

It's worth noting that this image depicts a logo (a "raspple") similar to the
logo of the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF) [uploaded to Wikipedia][rpf-logo] on
2012-Dec-10.  The raspple is not intended to represent or misrepresent RPF, and
RPF neither supports nor endorses Raspple II to our knowledge.

The resemblence, while not coincidental, is an original created on graph paper
with pencil and calculator and light supplement of vector-editing tools,
largely due to its' creators far greater familiarity with mathematics than
with Inkscape.  :)

If you're a law-ninja (or a debian-legal mailing list contributor), your input
is welcome.  We're trying to do this right.  :)
